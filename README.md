# NodakPaleo
Paleontology database at the University of North Dakota.

Current alpha (still in alpha?) is at http://nodakpaleo.mattbk.com.

The website and database are built with [Drupal](http://drupal.org).  Source code for the website may show up here at some point (especially if custom themes or modules are developed), but most of the customization is stored in the database itself.  At the moment, this is acting as a public issue queue.
